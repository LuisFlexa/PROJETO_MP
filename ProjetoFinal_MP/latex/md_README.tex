In the project directory, you can run\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{$<$tt$>$yarn start$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Runs the app in the development mode.\textbackslash{} Open \href{http://localhost:3000}{\texttt{ http\+://localhost\+:3000}} to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\textbackslash{} You may also see any lint errors in the console.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{$<$tt$>$yarn test$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\textbackslash{} See the section about \href{https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests}{\texttt{ running tests}} for more information.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{$<$tt$>$yarn build$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Builds the app for production to the {\ttfamily build} folder.\textbackslash{} It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\textbackslash{} Your app is ready to be deployed!

{\bfseries{Note\+: this is a one-\/way operation. Once you {\ttfamily eject}, you can\textquotesingle{}t go back!}}

If you aren\textquotesingle{}t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can {\ttfamily eject} at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, E\+S\+Lint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except {\ttfamily eject} will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\textquotesingle{}re on your own.

You don\textquotesingle{}t have to ever use {\ttfamily eject}. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\textquotesingle{}t be useful if you couldn\textquotesingle{}t customize it when you are ready for it.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Learn More}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
